# Bankruptcy Prediction in Taiwanese Companies (1999â€“2009)

This project is a part of the course ENGIN178 - "Statistics and Data Science for Engineers", teached at UC Berkeley. The goal of this project is to apply statistics and machine learning models to solve a classification problem.

## Overview
This project compares machine learning models for predicting bankruptcy using financial data from 6,819 Taiwanese companies. The dataset includes 95 features (e.g., return on assets, current ratio) and a binary bankruptcy label.

**Key Techniques Explored**:
- **Feature Selection**: Correlation analysis, variance thresholding, stepwise selection.
- **Models**: Logistic regression (with LASSO/Ridge regularization), decision trees, ensemble methods, neural networks.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall (TPR), F1-score, accuracy (with emphasis on class imbalance considerations).
